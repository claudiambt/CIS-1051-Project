Creation of a phylogenetic tree of Cytochrome b for 10 different animals
Species:
1. Human
2. Cat
3. Salmon
4. Whale shark
5. Owl
6. Blue martin
7. Monarch Butterfly
8. Honey bee
9. Turtle
10. Gecko

Steps: 
1.Import BioPython 
2. Get gene code for each of the animals
3. Read each file individually
4. Combine individual sequences into a single file
5. Sequence alignment (there are several ways to do this)
6. Calculate the distance between each of the different species
7. Build the tree using tree constructor in BioPython
8. Visualize the tree using matplotlib
