Vertebrates and Invertebrates Phylogenetic Tree
- What have you done for your project so far?
I found and downloaded the genetic code of cytb gene 2 sets of reptiles, birds, fish, mammals, and insects. So far, I was able to import the files into the program, read them, and combine them into a single file. I then was able to align them using ClustalOmega, create a matrix with the distances and build an ASCII tree.
- What have you not done for your project yet?
I have not done the visualization on matplotlib part of the project.
- What problems, if any, have you encountered?
I was able to get a tree, but it is not accurate, I doesn't show the correct evolutionary relationship between species. This is because I chose a gene (cytb) is fast evolving, so to try to fix the tree, I will also incorporate a slow-evolving gene into the analysis.
