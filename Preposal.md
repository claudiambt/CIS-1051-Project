# CIS-1051-Project
Final project proposal
- Creation of a phylogenetic tree 
- Need to use Biopython and Matplotlib 

What needs to be done: 
1. Masterfile: create a Masterfile with the gene sequence of selected species 
2. Sequence Alignment: Aligning the DNA or protein sequences to identify homologous sites. 
3. Distance Calculation/Tree Construction: Calculating the evolutionary distance between sequences and then using an algorithm like UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) or Neighbor-Joining (NJ) to build the tree 
4. Visualization: Drawing or printing the tree structure 

Data will be acquired from either the NCBI GenBank or the Nucleotide Database. The phylogenetic tree will be built for a short gene (less than 1000 bp) using 5-10 species 

Potential genes:  
- Cytochrome b (cytb) 
- Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I 
- 12S rRNA (Small subunit ribosomal RNA) 

Species: 
- Mammals 
- Insects 
- Birds 
- Fish
